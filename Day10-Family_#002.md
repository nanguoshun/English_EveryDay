# Actual Story

Q: How close are you with your family?

I love t talk about my family. I have a great extended family with aunts and uncles and cousins spread out all over the world. 
My mom is the oldest of eight  so she had lots of brothers and sisters, and all that family we try to get together once in a 
while and keep in touch over Skype or some other internet means. But the real joy of my life is my immediate family with my 
twin boys and my beautiful wife. So I do everything I can to get out of my work quick and go spend time with them and just 
enjoy family life.
