M: That's not a "WoW", that's an "oh no". Disaster.

W: Well. happy belated birthday anyway.

M: Thanks you, At last, Better late than never

W: I am sorry. Do you feel different now that you're thirty?

M: I didn't even think about it until the day, and then my kept saying: "you are thirty, how does it feel?". I was like, "it's fine", but she kept saying it and I was like.

W: what were you like in your twenties?

M: **It was a decade of change.**, i think. The start of it, single, going to university. The end of it, married with a baby. 

W: Wow! Lots of changes.

M: **Big contrast**, how old are you ?

W: I am only four years younger than you.

W: When I i was teenage? I was carefree, because my only responsiblity was to be a student, right? And I was really into sports so I was really competitive.

W: I did field hockey.  Did you play sports in your teenage years?

M: Yeah, I am a massive fan of football. 

W: You still play?

M: **I am thinking about retiring now** that I have a baby.  Thirties, twenties, teens, it's just a number right? Age is what you make it. 

W: Exactly.
