Q: How you would like to live your life after retirement? How do you see yourself in 30 to 40 years?

A: I guess I will be working even inn my 70s an 80s because I want to work until I die. Because I want to be productive and 
energetic even when I'm in my 70s and 80s. I guess that's the key of living young for a long time, I guess. And also, when I 
get old, I want to travel with my hunsband because I love traveling and my dream is to travel all around the world. It would
be so nice to, you know, meet other people and see other cultures as well. And that'll be so nice. And, well, to be honest,
I didn't really think about my future as a long term in details because you know you can't really predict your life, your 
future. I think it's the beauty o life. So, well, I try to enjoy single moment (of life after retirement).
