M: So rachel, I hear yor're getting married soon?

W: I am.

M: Amazing! Did you always plan to get married?

W: No, I never thought I was going to get married at this age, but I was also never the type to plan out my life... When I am going to meet my future husband and when we're going to get married or I'm going to have kids. I just let nature take its course, and it worked out the way it did.

M: I think it's best just to see how it goes.

W: Did you have a gime frame? Did you know you were going to get married at this age and have kids at this age?

M: If I'm honest, then yes because I kind of planned what age I'd get married and what age I'd have a kid. It was 28 getting married, 29 to have a kid and so before 30 I would have a family. And it actually worked out that way.

W: Congratulations.

M: But as i got older, i forgot about that I just kind of dated. I met a fair share of girls, but not too many. But dating was really **hit and miss**. There were some good experiences, some terrible experiences. Once you're marrid it's kind of like a saft haven.

W: That's true. For me, I was kind of carefree about dating. But I did think serously about dating in the sense that I wasn't just going to date anyboy. If I was going to date someone, it would **have to be with the thought of**, "Do I have a future with this person?"

W: So that's the way I looked upon dating. I thought seriously about it before I **jumped into** a relationship. 

M: You just dated the special ones and it's worked out well and I'm sure as a married senior you are going to love it.

W: I look forward to it.
