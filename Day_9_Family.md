M: Rachel, how are your trip to the States?

W: It was amazing. I got to see and spend time with my family. I am really colse to my **immediate family** and my **extended family.**

M: they all live **over** in the States so it was just great to have a family reunion and get together.

M: You must miss them, living so far away from them.

W: I do. And after this recent trip i realized the value of family even more. It was **bittersweet** just saying farewell to them when i was coming back here to Korea.

W: I am really close to my sister, she's like my best friend so it was really great to see her and at the same time it was so sad to know that i was going to leave her again

M: That is bitterseet. It's same for me because my immedidate family, my mother and father, they live in Londong, which is miles away. We're really close-knit as well like a typical, i guess my mom is a typical Korea mum. But she's in London, it's really difficult for her, so i do miss them. 

W: now you have a son and your wife. do things on family kind of change for you? Like perspective on famliy?

M: Yeah, it's really strange, because now I have my own little family. And then above me it is my mum and dad so i'am a bit confused, because I only had my baby recently, but i think it **turns into** a bigger network and there is just more family love, I guess. And then it gets even more **close-knit**.

W: yeah, it is important for your grandchildren to have good relationships with their grandparents. It is connecting those generations. You know what they say: **blood is thicker than water.** 

M: It is. By **literally,**  So never forget about your family, and **don't take them for granted.**

W: I agree.
