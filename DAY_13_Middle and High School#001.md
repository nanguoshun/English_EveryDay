# Dialog
W: peter, I heard you were such a **partier** in your middle school and high school years.

M: I want to know where you got this information from. **I did like** to indugle in a little bit of social activity, throughout my middle and high school years. That is called secondary school in UK, acutally. But **I did study** as well.

M: I was a good student, but on weekends I liked **let my hair down for sure**. Rachel, you seem you would have been a little bit of a **goody two-shoes**. Like, as straight A student.

W: I was. During my teenage years, I was studious but, i was able to balance my friends and fun life with also my school life. So i was pretty good at just finding a **middle ground between the two.** 

M: sure, balance is key.

W: exactly, and i was this **straightedged**, stereotypical Asian student. I wasn't. I really like to play sport and I really like to spend time with my friend and study at the same time, because I knew grades were important.

M: sure, definitely with Asican parents, you get that durmmed into you. Right, the grades are important. But i am curious, do you still **keep in touch with** people that you went to middle school with?

W: I do, becuase my town is so small, my best friend since elementary school live right next door to me. So even though i don't get to see her for a long periods of time, when i do see her it seems like we just pick up from where we left off. So, it's really nice.

M: that is fantastic.

W: did you have a rebellion stage in middle and high school? during puberty?

M: Yeah, not to anyone else, but i feel sorry to my parents like i was very horrible to them at the time because i was angry. But i want to forget about that, and about high school and those exams for university. They were so stressfull.

M: So glad it's over.
