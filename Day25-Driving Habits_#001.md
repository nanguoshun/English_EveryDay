# Actual Talk

W: Hey Peter, I got a new car recently and I need to get it insured. Is car insurance expensive here in Korea?

M: Well, I don’t know compared to Australia, but compared to America, it seems to be much cheaper.

W: Oh really? How much cheaper? Like half the price, do you think?

M: I don’t know exactly,  but my motorcycle insurance was only $100 for the year.

W: Oh, my goodness. People here, they tend to get in more, smaller car accidents, like little scratches here and there. Parking here is a nightmare. Parking spaces are so teeny-tiny.

 M: Well, everything in Australia is very big and open, so the way Koreans drive, it’s amazing. They’re very good at parking in tiny little spots. And they always back in. 

W: I think that’s only way you can actually park in a space like that.

M: To park well. And I’m not used too that, so I’m not very good at it.

W: Oh, really? So, you own a motorcycle as well? Is that easier get around Seoul? I bought a small car as well just for that reason.

M: What kind of driver are you though? 

W: I’m not very aggressive by nature, but once I get behind the wheel, I tend to become a little more aggressive.

M: Scary Joanne?

W: No, because people tend to cut in front of me and I get very annoyed. I turn my indicator on to go into the next lane, people tend to speed up. I’m just like, why is that? I’m telling you, I’m going into that lane.

M: Everybody’s trying to get a little bit ahead.

W: And no one indicates either, so I don’t know whether they’re trying to come into my lane. I tend to be on the defensive, every time I’m behind the wheel.

M: I can be a pretty aggressive driver. I like going fast.

W: But you can never go fast here in Seoul. Traffic is like chock-a-block. It’s like a parking lot.

M: Well, I still enjoy driving once in a while.

W: Oh, that’s good. I don’t enjoy driving.
