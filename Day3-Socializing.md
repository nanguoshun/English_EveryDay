M: Everybody talks about the weather wherever you go. It is the topic of the day, and maybe something around your hobbies as well. Like you are into sport, maybe ask people who look a bit sporty. "did you see the game last night?"

W: Yeah, that's true, Because you want to find the similarities betwee
