# Actual Talk

M: My wife is always stressing about her weight and many girls I know are on a constant diet. Is that the same with you?

W: I guess if you say “constant” diet that is true. Because I try to be healthy all year round so I guess, a healthy lifestyle. So in that sense I guess it’s a constant diet. I tend to stick away from processed foods and white foods as in while rice, white sugar. So In that sense, I don’t know if you would call that a diet.

M: No, a lifestyle change is a better thing, I think. All these crash diets that you do for like a month or two moths and then you yo-yo. Your weight get up and down.

M: They’re really bad for you. But changing your lifestyle, that’s the kind of approach I take as well. Lots of fruit and veg, a balanced diet….we don’t eat too much red meat, because there are more and more studies coming out that says it’s not so good for you so maybe once or twice a week.

W: I love meat and like you. I eat lots of fruits and vegetables as well, but I also have to eat lots of meat and I don’t think I can ever be a vegetarian.

M: No, it’s too delicious; there is o other food that has that texture as well, right?

M: And I think you get more stressed if you avoid the foods you like, so even a little bit of junk food every now and then.

W: I think everything in moderation is key. So I’m a bit advocate of being able to eat whatever you want as long as it’s in moderation.

M: Sure, but sometimes I get confused about what moderation is like, how often are you allowed to eat junk food? The kind of information you get from the news and stuff is varying so, I’m not too sure. But one thing I never skip is breakfast, my favorite meal of the day.

W: I love having breakfast, especially for dinner.

M: Breakfast at any time of the day is fantastic.

W: Exactly.
