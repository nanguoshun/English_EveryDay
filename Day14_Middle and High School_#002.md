Q: What were you like in your teens?

A: When I was a teenagers, I was having a really hard time. Like other teenagers, I was going through puberty. So I started to
think about my future and my career and my life as a whole. And I had to think about going to school because.. It's not because
I didn't like to study really hard, but because I didn't really know the concept o studying really hard to be successful. 
Becaus I didn't really like my parents controlling myself, and also always on my back to study. So I started to talk back. And
it wasn't really great picture. And when I look back on my childhood, and also my teenagehood, I regret a lot, regret a lot
of things. I should've studied harder and should've made a lot of friends, because I was the one sat back in classroom and
didn't focus on studying in class. And I was a bad student. So i I could go back, I woul study harder and make good friends.
