Actual Story

Hello, everyone. My name is Peter Liptak and I'm looking forward to working with all of you here at EBS. As an employee, I'm 
hoping to meet each and every one of you individually and get to know you, as well as get your feedback on what we could do to 
improve things here.

As to (for) my background, I have a lot of experience in education and writing. I've worked in education for about twenty years:
been a professor, a private instructor, and also, even a pre-school teacher, so I'm fairly well-rounded in that experience. As 
a professional writer, I've been working for many years with large conglomerates and some governmental organizations, as well 
as publishing books. I publish ESL books, children's books and even books on Korea. Anyway, thank you all and please come and 
talk to me when you have a chance.
