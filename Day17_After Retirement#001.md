M: Rachel, a bit of **deep question**. Where do you **see youself** in 30 to 40 years.

W: Wow, that is very **profound question**! If i had to think about it quickly. I see myself with my husband and grandchildren running around in my large backyard. Have you thought about this question?

M: 30 to 40 years.. Well, I hope I am retired. I really I am not still working at that age. But at this rate I don't really plan for the future financially. I may still have to be working into my 70s and 80s.

W: Oh, no , you should just start saving now.

M: Yes, okay. Better late than never. Right? How about you, do you plan for your retirement in **the financial sence**?

W: I haven't. Actally. But right now as I am preparing for my wedding, I am thinking a lot about finances. And I am thinking about making a joint account with my future husband. And I think from there. We branch out and think about saving, and retirement funds, pensions and stuff like that. 

M: That's so complicated, right?

W: It's complicated.

M: When you are young, In your twenties and thirties, That seems like another lifetime away.

W: It does, but it's not, to be honest

M: Not at all, In another thirty, forty years we'll sitting here frail and old and thinking we should be started saving early.

W: But it's ok, because money isn't everything. When I am retired I would't mind living in some remote country and volunteering and working, living at a place where it's 

M: Sure, like you said, a nice big backyard, like a big nice house and maybe your grandkids come and play.

W: Right. Exactly. are you grandparents or your parents like that? Do they relax a lot right now?

M: No. My father still works, He's very old now, but he's still working. So i guess that's my anti-role model. I don't want to be like him, but i hope that we are both, at least, living and healthy in thirty to forty years.


# Keep these words in mind

- see oneself: to image oneself in a certain period. e.g. I see myself happily married with three children in ten years. I see my self teaching at a university in my forties.
- at this rate: Anyhow. e.g. At any rate, I'll be there for you wedding.
- work into ones's ~s. e.g. He was healthy and energetic engough work until his 90's.
- Financial sense: finally 
- Where I am retired I wouldn't mind~  e.g. When I'm retired, I wouldn't mind living in the countryside.
