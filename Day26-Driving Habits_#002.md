stickler: stick to the traffic rule

I am very **cautious** driver.  ( careful, denfensive) 

I'm a **stickler** about sticking to the rules of the road. (a person who follows the rules)

I always put on my **blinkers** when I turn left or right. (indicators)

I **make sure there is enough distance** between me and the driver ahead of me.

I usually **keep to the speed limit.**

Overall, my driving habits are pretty safe and **smooth sailing.** ( do things very smoothly)  

I usually **tend to** keep ot the speed limit or maybe go about 9 smiles per hous.  (tend to )
