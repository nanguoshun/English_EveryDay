W: peter, i saw a picture of your baby boy. and he looks very much like you physically.

M: he's very chubby Rachel, what are you trying to say?

W:NO, not the chubby part, but his eyes and his nose and his mouth.

M: Yeah, I htink physically he is similar to me but like emotional-wise and personality-wise he's quite different.

W: what were you like when you were younger?

M: When I first went to elementary school, we call it primary school in the UK, I cried so much for the first day. I was really a shy kid.

W: Where you a mom'boy

M: I was big time mama's boy. I am an only child and i didn't like to distrub anyone or anything like that. But Geeho, he likes shouting and screaming and getting everyone's attention. So I think emotionally we are very different. 

M: Did you ahve the same problem at all?

W: I think when you have older siblings you end up with learning how to talk quicker and your vocabulary grows faster. So i was very talktive but I did cry a lot like you, too. I was crybaby and it was because I always be with my mom.

M: and you being the youngest, as well.

W: I think so, every time my mon left me with another family memeber i would just cry, cry and cry. So i was really dislike by my family members.

M: well, I really help for the GeeHo's sake 

W: I hope so, too. Do you think he is very similar to your wife then?

M: He has got half-half and i think that is great for kids to take a bit from each parent. 

W: exactly.

M: nobody is perfect.
