I try to go to the big **grocery** stores around 8 o'clock when everything is on sale.

I really like cooking and food is something that everybody can enjoy.

If you have a **taste palate**, you can enjoy food.

I really like cooking and I have **a rule about cooking**.  ( have a rule about something)
