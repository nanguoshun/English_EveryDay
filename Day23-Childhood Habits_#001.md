# Actual Talk

M: When you were kid, were you afraid of monsters in the closet or under the bed?

W: I was afraid of monsters. I’m afraid of ghosts. I still am.

M: Ghosts?

W: Ghosts. But if they’re as cute as the monsters in the monsters animation movies, I don’t think I’d be afraid anymore. 

M: I never had that fear, as I can remember. Maybe I did when I was young, but I do remember that there were some trees outside the window that made a shadow that looked like a scary clown.

W: Oh. I used to be afraid of clowns, too. 

M: I don’t know why anyone thinks clowns are for children.
My parents took me to the circus and this clown came up to me and I started crying apparently.

W: And since then, clowns tends to give off a sad feel, scary feel to me. They’re not fun at all. I am sorry clowns out there.

M: Did you have to keep the closet door closed or anything?

W: I don’t think I did, but now that I think about it I think my mom tended to sort of, scan the room before she put me to bed.

M：What about other childhood habits?

W：Oh, I used to bite my fingernails.

M: Do you still?

W: I don’t. No. What my parents did was… they’d heard that if you put manicure on your fingernails, it would prevent child from biting it. Did not stop me.

M: the acrylic…really good for you. 

W: Really good. Extra keratin. No, wasn’t good for me at all. I think I stopped naturally when I got a little older. Yeah, but that was a bad habit of mine. I also used to walk like a duck. That’s what my dad said. He was like, can’t you walk like a proper lady? I’m like “ I’m not a lady yet. I’m a kid. It’s ok.   So, I used to have those kinds of habits. I think I’ve dropped them now.

M: I was a very active kid so I kind of walked on the balls of my feet. So I bounced when I walked. But luckily I learned to dance later and then I was very smooth. 

W: oh, what sort of dancing do you do?

M: I taught ballroom and Latin when I was young.

W: Latin dancing. Interesting. How romantic.
