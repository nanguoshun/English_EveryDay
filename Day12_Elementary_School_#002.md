# Actual Story

Well, I can't really recall my childhood because it was a long, long time ago. But from what I remember, I was wild annd also
very independent. Because I am an only child and my parents always told me to be brave, and confident and to do everything by 
myself. I was kind of, a bit, self-motivated as a result, which made my school life a lot easier because I studied by myself 
and I was a top student in class and I was the teacher's pet, I would say. But that was not the good thing at all because that
spoiled me, and I kind of bullied other students. So when I look back on my childhood, it's half and half. I have a happy
memory but also, at the same time, well, I was not a good student, I can say.
