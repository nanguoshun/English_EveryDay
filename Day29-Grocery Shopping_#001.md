# Actual Talk

W: Peter. You’ve gotta give me some ideas. I hate going shopping by myself. Buying for one is a nightmare. Everything’s in bulk. And I can’t buy 20 pack toilet rolls for myself.

M: That’s why you need a bigger place.

W: Get a bigger place, get some friends over. Who does the grocery shopping at your house?

M: Well, we used to go together a lot, but then once the babies were born, she would stay at home with the babies ad I’d go to the big, huge store and get the big, huge amounts of everything.

W: But you’re buying for four people.

M: Yeah, well. Two big people and two very, very little people.

W: So do you cook at home as well, do you tend to buy fruits and vegetables a lot more?

M: I go for the fruits and vegetable first.

W: I think that’s how the supermarkets are usually organized. You go in the you go to the fruits and vegetables section and then you go onto the meat ad poultry (section).

M: Yeah, because they figure that everybody will just buy all the snack food and leave.

W: Oh, right. I had no idea.

M: My wife and I both like fruits and vegetables a lot. Or, at least she likes fruits. So it’s a great way to start, and then you can plan all your meals.

W: The thing is, though, discount stores are good, but I tend to buy fruits and vegetables at the local markets. The fresh fruit markets, they (fruits and veggies) tend to be a lot fresher and a lot less expensive as well. And I’ve been using the local markets a lot more recently.

M: What do you tend to buy?

W: I buy a lot of cucumber, a lot of lettuce because I eat a lot of meat. Ah, what else? Tomatoes, and onions, as well. And if you go to the discount stores, you have to buy a bag of… a kilo of onions; whereas I can buy one onion for myself.

M: Ok, so do you make food just for yourself?

W: For myself and occasionally for a friend who comes over. But I have ‘a big hand’ - that’s what you call it in Korea - I cook for about four people when I ‘m by myself so it lasts me a few days.
