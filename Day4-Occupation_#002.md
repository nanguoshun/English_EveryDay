# Actual Story

Q: What do you do for a living?

A: As a writer, author and occasional entrepreneur. I've been very lucky in my career and have quite enjoyed the different things that happen each week...the different turns I take and the different projects I get to work on. Everything from working on things for the Korean government to helping them improve their international relations or doing things for some large companies... the projects can be very exciting. I aslo have a lot of free time, so I get to spend more time with my family than people with normal jobs, so that's been very rewarding. And, you know, I think as an author of books, it's a very time consuming process. So having the free time from other projects to do occasionally that is very nice. I try to do new and interesting things as much as possible, so I look forward to creating new things and new ideas. I've got many new books for children in the works and hopefully I'll get those done in the coming months and years. That's about it.
