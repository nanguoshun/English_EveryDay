M: Hey Rachel, how are you? 

W: I'm good but I'm a bit nervous.

M: Why?

W: I am **starting at at a new company**  in a couple of days, but i don't really know how to introduce myself to a new group of people.

M: The first day at a comany is **never-racking**, right? You meet so many **new faces** and they all know each other as well. **That is even worse.** But there are some things you should do on your first day.

W: I's love some advice.

M: Ok, A firm handshake, that is key, to *project confidience*, but not too hard, you don't want to hurt the other person, but 
not too flimsy as well. I hate a wet flimsy handshake. So if you are feeing nervous and sweaty, perhaps give your hand a wipe as well.

W: Oh, like a handerchief in my pocket or something.

M: Yeah, absolutely, If you don't have that, just **go to the back of your skirt or trousers**.

W: No, that is a great idea, 

M: Because when it's a sweaty hand...

W: Clammy hands.

M: They are going to call you clammy hands at the company.

W: Alrights, so a firm handshake is really important.

M: and then eye contact as well.

M: And a big smile, I think always helps, It makes people feel much more comfortable.

W: Yeah that's true, that definitely will leave a great first impression.

M: As long as you don't have something stuck in your teeth. Again, check.

W: *I'll have to get* a mirror and check my teeth. That's for sure. Alright *you are saying* a firm handshake is important, good eye contact, those show that I am confidient and then a friendly smile whill show that **I am at ease** and that I am comforatble with my surroundings.

M: Sure, and then maybe the last thing, remebmer people's name

W: Oh, right!

M: And when you say your ame as well, project it loudly.

W: But you know, there is so many people that I have to meet. How do I remember all their names?

M: I think writing it down as soon as you can, at the earlist possible .

W: You think so ?  Alrigts, well I can't wait to use that advice on my first day at my new company.

M: Fingers Crossed.

W: Thank you.
