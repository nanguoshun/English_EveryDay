M: Rachel what did you major in at university.
 
W: I stuied potical science and history, in the humanities.

M: Wow that sounds intelligent.. and difficult.

W: it was really fun.

M: really? potical science and history?

W: that's why i studied it, because i liked it.

M: that's why i chose my major as well, biological sciences. But it got so difficult; I actally despirsed it by the end of my course.

M: So you took a different career path, I see.

M: for sure, yeah. I wanted anothing to do with bialogy after i finished my course. But is your career linked to your degree?

W: yeah, a little bit. I mean, I am studying political science further right now, so that I can reach my end goal, which is to work for a development organization, some kind of hunmanitarian refief effort organization. I college, during the semester I studied a lot.

W: I did party a lot, too. You know, they say if you study hard, you can play hard, so that's what i did.

M: You should't just play hard.

W: and i the summer vocation times, i did internships.

M: Ok, well, the last question, is 

W: if i had to say one thing, I would say that i regret no studying more. I wasn't super studious, but i wish that i had taken everthing that i could from my classes... really soak up my brain. but there were times where i liked the fun, college aspect.

M: that's okay. and like we know. it is never to late to study. rachel. And you are still studying today.
