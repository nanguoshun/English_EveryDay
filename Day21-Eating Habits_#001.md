M: Joanne, I am so hungry.

W: Oh, same here.

M: Do you want to go get something to eat after this?

W: Yeah, definitely. What should we go get?

M: Something healthy?

W:  I've been snacking so much these days. What would be a healthy option?

M:  A healthy option? Bibimbab is pretty good.

W: Ahh, bibimbab. But I'm craving meat right now.

M: They put some meats in the bibimbab.

W: A little bit of meat in the bibimbab.... I like fried egg on my bibimbab, too.

M: What are your eating habits?

W: I tend to binge eat, which is the worst thing you can do. And because of my work schedule. I binge at around 11 o'clock
at night. I've been putting on so much weight these days.

M: I tend to forget to eat when I'm working. If I've focused on something. I'll go for hours and hours (without eating) and 
then suddenly realize, when my stomach is grumbling, that I haven't eaten.

W: Oh, your biological clock is like, "Oh, I'm hungry."

M: And then go out and eat.

W: I can't function when I don't eat. So I tend to snack during the day; I tend to eat a lot chocolate to keep my energy 
levels up, which is not good for you.

M: What about breakfast? They said the foundation for a healthy diet is eating a good breakfast.

W: I know the foundation is a good breakfast, but I tend to skip breakfast, which is bad. I tend to catch up on my sleep during
the early morning hours so I miss out on breakfast. I skip on lunch because I'm so busy and then I eat dinner, after work.

M: Ok. Let's get some healthy food right away.

W: Alright, thank you.
