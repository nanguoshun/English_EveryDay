# Actual Talk


M: You know, one of my first job in university was selling these coupon books to a local car wash. It was the worst job ever, I had to go door to door. 

W: How did people react to coupon books? 

M: Oh, I didn’t really sell many.

W: Really?

M: Do you…..What kind of spender are you? Do you try to save money?

W: I used to be an impulse buyer, which was the worst thing you can do, especially here in Korea. ‘Cause I’ve checked online and it is a shopper’s heaven.

W: You get discounts. It’s sale every single day and you get credit points as well. So if you stack up on your points you can get a another free item.

M: You can buy more.

W: Exactly! Buy more! So, it’s a waste of time going offline. I like the shopping experience, browsing through the stores and trying on the clothes and stuff.

M: I think that’s a woman’s thing. Men tend not to like shopping. 

W: So you’re in and out?

M: I will wait until the last minute that I need something or wait a whole year. And I will go to my hometown, go way out to the countryside to the outlet stores and do a year’s worth of shopping in three hours.

W: I don’t think it’s possible…Don’t you need clothes for every single season? 
M: Yeah, they are on sale.

W: So you can find your size, and your color and it fits you quite well.

M: Sure.

W: Well, you’re very lucky, cause if I don’t get out there early, my size is totally sold out. So I need to…

M: Especially in Korea. You’re the Korean size.

W: I am the Korean size. My feet are a little small, so I do need to get tailored shoes and I need to get in early so all the sizes are there when I’m there. But I’ve definitely gotten a liking to online shopping. (They’re the) best to get discounts.

M: Do you keep track of your expenditures?

W: I didn’t, but I found this really good  smart phone application which sends me a text and shows me how much I’ve accumulated over the past few weeks. And I sort of go, :Ok, I’ve hit this line, I should stop spending now. It’s a good application to have.

M: Let’s stop spending now.

W: Haha, right!
