#Actual Story:

Q: How would you introduce yourself at a social gathering?

A: Hey, nice to meet you. My name is Peter and I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've been here in Korea for a long time now. 
I'm a big movie buff. And even though I love to catch all the movies when they're out in the theater, as a father of young 
children.￼ I don't really have much time to these days. I also enjoy dancing. I used to be a dance instructor, so whenever I 
can, I go out dancing - hit the town. And I love to exercise, so I'm into running and biking and swimming. I do some triathlons, the occasional marathon and even an ultra-marathon from time to time. Hopefully. I'll get to learn more about you.
