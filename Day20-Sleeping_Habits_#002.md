Q: Talk about your sleeping habits?

A: At night, I tend to be a restless sleeper. I don't really get a good night's rest. I'm not sure why, but ever since I can
remember, I wouls toss and turn a lot at night. I do know that when I exercise I do get a much better sleep at night. I sleep
like a baby at those times. Some other sleepingg habits that I have, I tend to sleep or go to bed early. Around ten o'clock my
eyes start getting drowsy and groggy and I'm usually in bed by eleven and in that sense, I'm more of an early bird rather than
a night owl. I like to wake up early in the morning because I believe that the early bird gets the worm. But other than that,
I'm not a very deep sleeper, so I need to find more ways where I get a good night's rest.
