# Diaglog

M: I was at a party the other day and it was so good but there was this guy who stuck out in my mind. He was really awkward and standing in the corner. I felt really sorry for him. He mumbled when he was introducing himself. I think he was really uncomfortable when about meeting new people in a social setting.

W: Oh, no, if I were him, I would prepare some questions, some general questions beforehand.

M: Yeah, questions are easier.

W: Exactly, thinks like weather. That is always a general topic anybody can talk about.

M: Everybody talks about the weather wherever you go. It is the topic of the day, and maybe something around your hobbies as well. Like you are into sport, maybe ask people who look a bit sporty. "did you see the game last night?"

W: Yeah, that's true, Because you want to find the similarities between the people you are meeting for first time, you can delove into deeper converstation and get to know each other.

M: But stay off some sensitive topics, because you can **hit an awkward moment**. 

W: Religion and politics?

M: Absolutely, don't go too deeper. Don't **start waffling on about** your interest when other person just doesn't care. 

W: And you have to pick up all those cues to know when this person disinterested.
